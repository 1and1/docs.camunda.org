On base of our Service Level Agreement you have the chance to address your questions, wishes and problems to our support service.


## Create a support ticket

We distinguish three types of issues:

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
  <tr class="success">
    <th>Issue Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Important Notes</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Bug Report</td>
    <td>File a bug report if a feature of the system doesn't work properly.</td>
    <td>Do not file missing features as bug request, even if you think that is a really vital feature that makes the product unusable without it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Feature Request</td>
    <td>Any missing features can be filed here.</td>
    <td>A feature request might be declined with some reasoning why this will not be part of the product. Otherwise it is usually pulled on the road-map and we inform you about status changes. Please add some information about your use case and why this feature is important to you.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Help Request</td>
    <td>File any questions you have as help requests that are unrelated to any bug or feature request.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

To create a new support ticket follow the instructions below. To shorten the processing time please provide us as much information as possible.

      Go to our <a href="https://app.camunda.com/jira/browse/SUPPORT">JIRA support system</a> and select <code>Create Issue</code>. Select <code>Support</code> as project and choose the desired issue type. Give the ticket a meaningful <code>Summary</code>. You can give your ticket a <code>Priority</code> depending on how urgent the issue is for you. Provide us a date in terms of important <code>deadlines</code>. Enter a detailed <code>description</code> of your issue. In case of <b>Bug Reports</b> please use the template (<b>Reproduce steps</b>, <b>Problem</b>, <b>Expected behavior</b>, etc.). <code>Attachments</code> like screenshots, log files or bpmn files help us to find your bug faster. You can add <code>Authorized support contacts</code> if you want to share the tickets with your colleagues.

## Authorize other support contacts of the company for a support case

<div class="row">

  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-9">
    <p>
      Due to privacy reasons you cannot see support cases which weren't created by yourself. It is often handy that your colleague may see the issue, at least if you go to vacation. This is easily possible, you have to add the email address of your colleague to the field <b>Authorized support contacts</b> as shown in the screenshot.
    </p>
  </div>

Please note:

* You cannot search for users, you have to know the exact email address.
* You have to add the authorized support contacts for all issues you want to share.
* You can only add users which have are entitled camunda fox enterprise support contacts to the authorized support contacts, otherwiese you will get an error message that the user with that email address is not found.
* You can remove authorized support contacts any time, then they will not be able to see this issue any longer.
