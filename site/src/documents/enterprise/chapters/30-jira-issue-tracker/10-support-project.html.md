On base of our Service Level Agreement you have the chance to address your questions, wishes and problems to our support service.


## Create a support ticket

We distinguish three types of issues:

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
  <tr class="success">
    <th>Issue Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Important Notes</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Bug Report</td>
    <td>File a bug report if a feature of the system doesn't work properly.</td>
    <td>Do not file missing features as bug request, even if you think that is a really vital feature that makes the product unusable without it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Feature Request</td>
    <td>Any missing features can be filed here.</td>
    <td>A feature request might be declined with some reasoning why this will not be part of the product. Otherwise it is usually pulled on the road-map and we inform you about status changes. Please add some information about your use case and why this feature is important to you.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Help Request</td>
    <td>File any questions you have as help requests that are unrelated to any bug or feature request.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

To create a new support ticket follow the instructions below. To shorten the processing time please provide us as much information as possible.

    <p>
      Go to our <a href="https://app.camunda.com/jira/browse/SUPPORT">JIRA support system</a> and select `Create Issue`. Select `Support` as project and choose the desired issue type. Give the ticket a meaningful `Summary`. You can give your ticket a `Priority` depending on how urgent the issue is for you. Provide us a date in terms of important `deadlines`. Enter a detailed `description` of your issue. In case of _Bug Reports_ please use the template (_Reproduce steps_, _Problem_, _Expected behavior_, etc.). `Attachments` like screenshots, log files or bpmn files help us to find your bug faster. You can add `Authorized support contacts` if you want to share the tickets with your colleagues.
