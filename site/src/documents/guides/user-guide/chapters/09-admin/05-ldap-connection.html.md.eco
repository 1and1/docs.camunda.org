If you connect the camunda BPM platform with the LDAP identity service you have read-only access to the users and groups. Changes can be down via the LDAP system but not via the admin application. Find more information about how to configure the process engine in order to use the LDAP identity service [here](#bpmplatform-engine-identity-ldap).
