In the following example we walk through a typical human workflow scenario. The Tasklist has four demo users which belong to different user groups. Sign in with the user _demo_ and start a process instance.

<%- @H2('Start a Process') %>

<div class="row">
  <div id="tasklist-start-process" class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-3" data-img-thumb img-src="<%= @docUrl('assets/img/implementation-tasklist/tasklist-start-process.png') %>">
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-9">
    <p>
      To start a process instance via the Tasklist hit the <button class="btn btn-xs"><i class="caret"></i> Start a Process </button> dropdown button and select a process. If there is no process listed please check that your process is deployed correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on whether you have defined a [start form](#tools-tasklist-task-forms) for your process it will be displayed now. Otherwise you get the notification that no form has been defined for starting the process. In this case click `Start process using generic form`. The [generic task form](#tools-tasklist-task-forms-generic-task-forms) allows you to enter variables for your process.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our example you have to enter the desired values and hit `Start Process` to step through.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<%- @H2('Working on Tasks / Task Completion') %>

Tasks that are assigned to you are listed on the Tasklist main page where you can hit the <button class="btn btn-xs"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-play"></i> </button> button to start working on a task.

<div class="row">
  <div id="tasklist-form-assign-approver" class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-3" data-img-thumb img-src="<%= @docUrl('assets/img/implementation-tasklist/tasklist-form-assign-approver.png') %>"></div>
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-9">
     <p>In our example [task form](#tools-tasklist-task-forms) you are asked to assign an approver for your invoice. Enter a colleague's name who should be assigned to approve the task. Have a look at the [Task Overview](#tools-tasklist-human-workflow-management-user-and-group-task-overview). The assigned task is now in your colleague's folder.</p>
     <p>If no task form is defined for a [Start Event](<%= @docUrl('api-references/bpmn20/#!/tasks/user-task)') %> you will be forwarded to a [generic form](#tools-tasklist-task-forms-generic-task-forms). In a generic form you can define the input data yourself.</p>
  </div>
</div>

When you complete a task by submitting the task form, the task is completed and the process continues in the engine.

<div class="row">
  <div id="tasklist-diagram" class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-3" data-img-thumb img-src="<%= @docUrl('assets/img/implementation-tasklist/tasklist-diagram.png') %>"></div>
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-9">
    Furthermore you can visualize the process model by clicking on the <button class="btn btn-xs" title="Display BPMN Diagram"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-search"></i></button> symbol. By highlighting the current task the visualization gives you also information your task on the context of the whole process.
  </div>
</div>

<%- @H2('User and Group Task Overview') %>

<div class="row">
  <div id="tasklist-main-info" class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-3" data-img-thumb img-src="<%= @docUrl('assets/img/implementation-tasklist/tasklist-main-info.png') %>"></div>
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-9">
    <p>In the User and Group Task overview you can see how many tasks are assigned to you, the different groups and your colleagues. Have a look in your colleagues' folder. You will see that you can see their tasks but you are not able to work on them.</p>
    <p>The folder `Inbox` contains all tasks that are assigned to the user groups. Like tasks of a group they are ready to be [claimed](#tools-tasklist-human-workflow-management-un-claim-a-task).</p>
  </div>  
</div>

<%- @H2('(Un-)Claim a Task') %>

<div class="row">
  <div id="tasklist-claim" class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-3" data-img-thumb img-src="<%= @docUrl('assets/img/implementation-tasklist/tasklist-claim.png') %>"></div>
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-9">
    <p>If tasks are assigned to a group, more than one person sees it at once. In order to avoid different people working on it at the same time, the task needs to be claimed first. By claiming a task you become the assignee and the task is moved to your personal tasks folder ("My Tasks"). Hit the <button class="btn btn-xs dropdown-toggle"><i class="caret"></i> </button> button and select `claim`.</p>
    <p>User can also unclaim a task by selecting `unclaim`. The task will go back to the associated user group.</p>
  </div>
</div>

You can bulk (un-)claim tasks after selecting multiple tasks via `strg + click`.

<%- @H2('Delegate a Task') %>

<div class="row">
  <div id="tasklist-delegate" class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-3" data-img-thumb img-src="<%= @docUrl('assets/img/implementation-tasklist/tasklist-delegate.png') %>"></div>
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-9">
    When you delegate a task to one of your colleagues he has the possibility to take a look at your task and give it back to you. This can be helpful if you want to get help from a colleague or you need feedback. To delegate a task doesnâ€™t mean that you assign it to someone else. After delegation, you are still the assignee of the task. If you do not want to be the assignee of a task, use the [(un-)claim function](#tools-tasklist-human-workflow-management-un-claim-a-task).
